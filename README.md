An implentation of the Infection project for Khan Academy's application process. The official description of the parameters can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/a/khanacademy.org/document/d/1NiKv-MjULOFyyc8f5w8R_EqvuPJ10wJVJgZhtTK9VKc/edit#heading=h.24vvz52659j3).

I chose to complete this project in Python both because the majority of my portfolio is in a web-focused language (JavaScript, PHP, etc.) and because Python is high level enough to focus on the conception parts of the project as opposed to a language like C.
